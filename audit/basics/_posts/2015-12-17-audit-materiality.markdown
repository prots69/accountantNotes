In 2009 the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) completed a project (known as the ‘Clarity Project’) to update and reformat the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). The Auditing Practices Board (APB) issued new ISAs for the UK and Ireland in October 2009 which incorporate the clarified ISAs issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). The new standards apply to audits of financial statements for periods ending on or after 15 December 2010. 

There are two ISA standards related to materiality: *ISA 320 "Materiality in Planning and Performing an Audit"* and *ISA 450 "Evaluation of Misstatements Identified During the Audit"*.  

**Materiality**

Misstatements, including omissions, are considered to be material if they, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. (ISA 320 para 2) 

### Overall materiality ###

Overall materiality or [planning materiality]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/calc-of-plan-materiality.pdf) is a materiality set for the financial statements as a whole. To calculate it several benchmarks may be used, which one is the most appropriate is the matter of professional judgement:


|---------------------|-----------|
| revenue             | 0.5% - 1% |
| profit before tax   | 5% - 10%  |
| total assets        | 1% - 2%   |


During the audit we collect misstatements (unless trivial) and we make an assessment if they are material at financial statements level. If the aggregate total of misstatements are less than overall materiality, the audit report can include an opinion that accounts "are free from material misstatements" unless it is for qualitative reasons (due to their nature). Let's say, our overall materiality is set at £1m (PBT-profit before tax x 5%). 


### Performance materiality (PM) ###

PM is set at a level below overall level and determines the type of work we perform at the level of individual account balances. If, for example, our overall materiality is £1m, then the PM should be lower than that, let's say £500k-£750k. Some audit firms set it at 70-75% of overall materiality. The level of PM is based on risk assessment (nature of entity, environment, history of misstatements and controls) and past audit experience. 

Some account balances may be too small and thus be excluded from audit work. Do we need to exclude them? Are they complete? Auditor has to use professional judgement.

### Specific materiality ###

This type of materiality may be well below the PM and set for a specific account balances or transactions if they are deemed to be importatant for users of financial statements (examples: contractors balance in a construction company, acquisition, directors' renumeration) or related to a key area (cash balance, disclosure).
