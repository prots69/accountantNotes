Entities qualifying as large or medium-sized under the *Companies Act 2006* will need to transition to FRS 102, The Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015, unless they opt for application of the EU-adopted IFRS.

#### The thresholds are: #### 

| turnover | - £10.2m
| balance sheet total | - £5.1m
| number of employees |  - 50.
|

The thresholds apply for reporting requirements from 2015 and became audit thresholds for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2016.  

Medium-sized entities qualifying as small under the increased thresholds, have the option of using the small entity provisions in FRS 102 for periods from 1 January 2016, effectively avoiding having to produce a cashflow statement, a statement of changes in equity and a statement of total comprehensive income and consolidated accounts, as well as having to produce a total of only 13 disclosures. 

Some small companies accounts are prepared under FRSSE 2015; FRSSE 2015 will be replaced by the small entity provisions within FRS 102 for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. The main differences between FRSSE 2015 and the small entity provisions in FRS 102 will be in respect of the recognition and measurement of various items in the financial statements, while presentation and disclosures will be broadly consistent. 

Small entities should consider whether adopting the small entity provisions in FRS 102 as soon as they are available, rather than transitioning to the FRSSE 2015 first, would be a better option in terms of costs and consistency of financial information produced.
