There are some important considerations on company various forms of finance. Long-term debt finance will consider debentures, loan stock, bonds, long-term loans from banks and other financial institutions, and convertibles and warrants. Medium-term finance is finance provided by mortgages, leasing, comercial bills and certificates of deposit. The line between long-term and medium is to some extent aribitary.

### Debenture

Expressions debentures and bonds can be used interchangeably. Company debentures can also be referred 
to as 'loan stock'. The company agrees to repay the printcipal to the lender by some future date, and in each year up to repayment it will pay a stated rate of interest in return for the use of the funds.

Debentures and debenture stock can be both secure and insecure. However, 'debenture' is used for 
referring to the more secure form of issue, and loan stock for less secure issues.

Almost all bond and debenture deeds and an increasing percentage of bank loan agreemnets contain 
restrictive 'negative' covenants. These covenants restricts the borrower's right to take certain actions until the debt has been repaid in full. They do not protect the lender in the event of default, but they do influence some of the factors that could lead to defaults. The lender's risk can be significantly reduced by what are known as credit enhancements. These include credit insurance, third party guarantees and collateral.

Debentures are irredeemable or perpetual where there is no date specified by which redemption must 
take place, so it is a rare method of raising finance. 

#### Value of bonds

The bond value is the sum of the present value of the par value repaid at maturity and the present value of coupon (interest) payments. This can be summarised in the formula:

<p>
$${V}_t = {( \sum_{n=1} {C \over (1+i)^n} ) + {R \over (1+i)^N}}.$$
</p>
where C - coupon payment (Bond at face value x % interest), n - number of payments, i - market interest rate, R - redemption value

*Example*: a government bond with a coupon rate of 5% is redeemable in one year's time. What would be the price of the bond today if the market rate of interest on bonds in a similar risk class is 10%?

<p>
$${V} = { {5 \over (1.10)} + {100 \over (1.10)} = 95.46 }.$$
</p>

The bond would be selling for £95.46. This gives an interest yield of

<p>
$${ \frac{5}{95.46} \; x  \; 100 = 5.24 }.$$ 
</p>

Thus, there is an inverse relationship between the yield of a bond and its price or value. The higher rate of return (or yield) required, the lower the price of the bond, and vice versa. However, it should be noted that this relationship is not linear, but convex to the origin.

The redemption yield (yield to maturity) is the total return (capital including interest) obtained from holding on to the security until its redemption. The redemption yield is sometimes above the interest yield and sometimes below it. The relationship depends on the coupon rate on the bond and the current interest yields in the market. If the coupon rate on a particular bond is above the current interest yields in the market the redemption yield will be lower than the interest yield. If the coupon rate is lower than the currrent interest yields the redemption yield will be higher than the interest yield. 

The good demonstration of the estimated bond value using excel is done [here](http://www.tvmcalcs.com/index.php/calculators/apps/excel_bond_valuation)

### Convertible loan stock

The holder of the bond is given the option of converting this loan stock within a given time period into equity shares at a specified price. 
The advantage to the bondholder is in the fact, if the company is successful and the share price rises, the investor will be keen to exercise the option; if not, he is free to retain the loan investment.


### Medium-term note (MTN)

MTN is a promise to pay a certain sum at a named date. A company wishing to obtain funds writes such a note and sells it in the market place. The MTN can have a maturity of anything from nine months to 15 years. Notes can be issued with floating interest rates, fixed rates or sero coupon rates. They can be priced at a premium or a discount.

*Floating rate notes* (FRN) are promissory notes with a floating interest rate.

### Bank loans

Bank loans are one of the most forms of finance for small and medium-size firms.
They can be on a repayment or interest-only basis and can be structured to meet the business’s needs. 

Bank loans come with the interest charge, the security and the repayment schedule.

The direct costs are usually associated with a bank loan are:  

- arrangement fees 
   Admin charges to reserve the funds and they will vary depending on the complexity of the business, its size and risk.
- interest
   Interest is charged depending on risk of default. Interest rate can be fixed or variable (London 
Interbank Offered Rate [LIBOR] + margin).
- insurance
   Especially key person insurance, may be a condition of the loan application.
- covenant compliance costs
- professional advice.
   Better rates can normally be obtained when the bank loan is secured, as the risk to the lender will 
generally be lower. The security provided by the borrower can be business assets, guarantees or security or third-party guarantees or security.


### Interest rate swaps

The motive behind the swap arrangement is that the company that has borrowed at a fixed rate wishes to service a floating rate loan taken by the other company. With the other company the position is reversed.

>An interest rate swap is a contractual agreement between two parties to exchange interest payments.

The parties never exchange the principal amounts. On the payment date, it is only the difference between the fixed and variable interest amounts that is paid; there is no exchange of the full interest amounts.

#### Interest rate management

The focus of the topic is how to manage the risks successfully given various options to choose from futures, options, forward contract or interest rate swap. There is a good example of the strategy in the ACCA exam [question](http://www.accaglobal.com/gb/en/student/exam-support-resources/professional-exams-study-resources/p4/technical-articles/irrm.html#TitansFC) paper.
