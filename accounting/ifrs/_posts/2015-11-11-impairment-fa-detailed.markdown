Here are more details on the approach of assessing Expected Credit Losses (ECL) of the financial instrument. The general overview on impairment is in the other post [Impairment of financial assets]({% post_url 2015-12-15-impairment-of-financial-assets %}).

The overview of details based on ACCA article ["Nine lives"][acca_9lives] published in July 2015 and PWC publication ["IRFS 9 - Expected Credit Losses"][pwc_ECL] are summarised here.

#### General approach in assessment of ECL ####

3 stage approach assessment of ECL or <b>"general model"</b>:

1. FA has a low risk or there have not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition:
- provision based on 12 month ECLs (if a credit risks improve, the provision should revert to 12 month basis again).

2. There has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition (but no objective evidence of impairment):
- provision based on lifetime ECL, but interest calculated on gross-carrying amount of FA.
In accessing whether the credit risks has increased significantly management looks at the <em>change in the risk of a default</em> occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument rather than the change in the ECLs. Entities can assess ECLs on a collective basis. Expected credit losses are the weighted average credit losses with the probability of default (‘PD’) as the weight. 

3. FA that have objective evidence of impairment at the reporting date: 
- lifetime ECL are recognized and interest revenue is calculated on the net carrying amount (that is, net of credit allowance).

#### Simplified model of ECL for trade and lease receivables ####

<p><b>"Simplified approach"</b> for trade receivables, contract assets or lease receivables:</p>
- if the asset without significant financing component:
"simplified model" (no need to access a significant risk) - lifetime ECL;
- with significant financing component:
either "general model or 3 stage" or "simplified".

#### Purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (unchanged from IAS 39) ####

- A FA is considered credit-impaired on purchase or origination if there is evidence of impairment (as at the point of initial recognition (acquired at a deep discount).
- Impairment is determined based on full lifetime ECL on initial recognition. However, lifetime ECL are included in the estimated cash flows when calculating the effective interest rate on initial recognition, thus no loss allowance is recorded at initial recognition.
- Any subsequent changes in lifetime ECL, both positive and negative, will be recognized immediately in profit or loss. 
-  If the FA is no longer credit-impaired and the improvement in credit quality can be related objectively to a certain event, such as an improvement in the credit rating of a loan creditor, then the interest revenue can again be calculated by applying the EIR to the gross carrying amount. If there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the financial asset, then the gross carrying amount of the financial asset should be written off.

#### Assessing a significant increase in risk ####

- If the risk significantly increased, management should consider reasonable and supportable best information available without undue cost or effort. This information should include actual and
expected changes in external market indicators, internal factors and borrower-specific
information.

- Examples:
1. Establishing the initial maximum credit risk for a particular portfolio by product type and/or region (the ‘origination credit risk’) and comparing that to the credit risk at the reporting date. This would only be possible for portfolios of financial instruments with similar credit risk on initial recognition;
2. Assessing increases in credit risk through a counterparty assessment, as long as such
assessment achieves the objectives of the proposed model; and 
3. An actual or expected significant change in the financial instrument’s external credit rating.

- If past info not available, there is a rebuttable presumption that credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition no later than when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.

- If there is a historical evidence that demonstrates that there is no correlation between significant increases in the risk of a default occurring and financial assets on which payments are more than 30 days past due, but that evidence does identify such a correlation when payments are more than 60 days past due.

#### Level at which a significant risk assessment should be performed ####

- On individual and portfolio basis. 
- Management might not be able to identify significant changes in credit risk for individual financial instruments before the financial instrument becomes past due (retail loans);
- Management can group financial instruments on the basis of shared credit risk characteristics. Examples:
the instrument type, the credit risk ratings, the collateral type, the date of origination, the remaining term to maturity, the industry, the geographical location of the borrower, the value of collateral relative to the commitment if it has an impact on the probability of a default occurring (for example, non-recourse loans in some jurisdictions or loan-to-value ratios).
- Individual exposures could be grouped into sub-portfolios on the basis of common borrower-specific characteristics, such as geographical location or postcodes, headroom/access affordability at origination or behavioral scoring (that is, ‘bottom up’ approach). 
- Alternatively management could estimate the proportion of the portfolio that has experienced a significant increase in credit risk using general information and calculate expected credit losses on that basis (that is, ‘top down’ approach). 

#### Measurement of ECL ####

-  The estimate of ECL does not require a detailed estimate for periods that are far in the future – for such periods, management may extrapolate projections from available, detailed information. PwC observation:
The standard is not specific on how to extrapolate projections from available information. Different ways of extrapolation can be used. For example, management could apply the average ECL over the remaining period or use a steady rate of expected credit losses based on the last available forecast. These are only examples, and other methods might apply. Management should choose an approach and apply it
consistently.
- In practice, this may not need to be a complex analysis. In some cases relatively simple modelling may be sufficient, without the need for a large number of detailed simulations of scenarios. For example, the average credit losses of a large group of financial instruments with shared risk characteristics may be a reasonable estimate of the probability-weighted amount. In other situations, multiple scenarios that specify the amount and timing of the cash flows for particular outcomes and the estimated
probability of those outcomes may be needed.

#### Operational simplification upon transition ####

	Objective - to determine FA 
- with low credit risk;
- where contractual obligations are 30 days past

#### Challenges facing management in implementation of IFRS 9 on ECL ####

- most entities do not collect enough credit info required by the standard;
- need to build new models to access ECL on 12 month period and over lifetime;
- develop definitions of credit default, low risk
