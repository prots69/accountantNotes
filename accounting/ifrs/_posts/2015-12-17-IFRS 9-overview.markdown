IFRS-9 sets out important principals for recognition and measurement of financial assets. Below are important points to consider when dealing with various aspects of FA (financial assets)

#### Important considerations ####

1. Initial measurement - at amortised cost or FV (fair value). 
For the test is to satisfy <b>two criteria</b>:
 - business model
 - contractual cashflows 

At amortised cost:

-	business model objective is to hold the financial asset to collect contractual cashflows rather than to sell it before maturity 
-	contractual cashflow test is whether contractual terms of the financial asset give rise, on specified dates, to cashflows that SOLELY are principal and interest on that outstanding principal .

Examples:

- loan receivable - at cost (if business objective is to held it to collect contractual cashflows and cashflows consist only of principal and interest). In other words these cashflows are fixed (principal with fixed rate or floating rate interest)
- investment in a convertible loan note - at FVTPL (fair value through P&L). The inclusion of conversion option is not deemed to represent payments of principal and interest.


2. Option to <b>reclassify a FA</b> that meet amortised cost criteria to FVTPL in order to reduce/eliminate a mismatch in the accounting treatment. Example: fixed-rate loan receivable that it hedges with an interest rate swap that changes the fixed rates for floating rates.

3. Classification - on initial recognition and 
<b>reclassifications are only permitted on the change of an entity's business model and are expected to occur only infrequently</b>. Example - reclassification from amortised cost to fair value would be when an entity decides to close its mortgage business, no longer accepting new business, and is actively marketing its mortgage portfolio for sale.
