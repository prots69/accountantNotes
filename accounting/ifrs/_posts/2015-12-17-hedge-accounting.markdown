### Important points:

- Hedge accounting requirements are optional in iFRS-9,
- When en entity first applies iFRS 9, it may choose to continue to apply hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39,
- For fair value hedge of interest rate risk of a portfolio of financial assets or liabilities en entity can use IAS 39,
- Hedge accounting can be applied if certain eligibility and qualification criteria are met.

**Hedged item**

- the one which exposes an entity to risk of changes in fair value or future cash flows

**Hedged instrument**

- These are the contracts companies enter into in order to protect themselves from losses on hedged items.
The contracts not only cover risks, but also eliminate a potention gain on a hedged item. 

**Hedge accounting - basic principle:**

- seeks to refect the substance of the hedge, or why a company entered into a particular contract (hedging instrument) in relation to a particular hedge item. Hedge accounting is trying to match any loss (or gain) on a hedged item against a gain (or loss) on a hedging instrument. This exercise leads to calculation to hedge effectiveness. Let's say, a gain in fair value of a hedged item of £300m would be offset against a loss of £270m on a hedging instrument. In this case the hedge would be 90% effective (270 / 300).


### IAS 39 on Hedge accounting

have a basic rules on:

- hedged items;
- hedged instruments;
- when a hedging relationship exist;
- accounting for gains/losses on certain types of hedging relationships

#### **Hedged items in IAS 39**

They can be the following:

- a single recognised asset or liability, firm commitment, or a highly probable transaction,
- a group of assets, liabilities, firm commitments, or highly probable forecast transactions,
- an investment for foreign currency or credit risk (but not for interest risk or prepayment risk),
- a portion of the cash flows or fair value of a financial asset or financial liability,
- a non-financial item for foreign currency risk only for all risks of the entire item,
- a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk (Macro Hedge) only,
- a portion of the portfolio of financial assets or financial liabilities that share the risk being hedged.

#### **Hedging instruments in IAS 39**

- are derivative contracts with an external counterparty, except for some written options. 

- However a non-derivative financial asset or liability may not be designated as a hedging instrument except as a hedge of foreign currency risk. 

 
#### **Hedging relationship in IAS 39**

exists if:

- formally designated and documented at inception, including the entity's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how the entity will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness, and
- expected to be **highly effective** (if it falls in **80% - 125% effectiveness rule**) in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk as designated and documented, and effectiveness can be reliably measured, and
- assessed on an ongoing basis (both prospectively and retrospectively) and determined to have been highly effective.
- all hedge **ineffectiveness** is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss (including ineffectiveness within the 80% to 125% window)

**FV hedge**

- A fair value hedge is defined as a hedge of the **exposure to changes in fair value** of a recognised asset or liability

*Example*:
 
- the asset with a FV of £100m is expected to fall in value, so the company entered in a derivative contract to protect it. By next reporting date, the asset's value fell to £75m and a hedge produced a gain of £30m. The hedge effectiveness is assessed as highly effective 120% (£30m / £25m). This is within the hedge accounting rules, so the loss of £25m on the hedged item can be offset against the gain of £30m on the hedged instrument, and the net result of £5m is recorded in the profit and loss.

**Cash flow hedge**

- A cash flow hedge is defined as a hedge of the exposure to **variability in cash flows** that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability (such as all or some future interest payments on variable rate debt) or a highly probable forecast transaction and could affect profit or loss.

*Examples*:

 - If a company is concerned that the price it will have to pay for next year's raw materials will rise it can designate this as a hedged item and enter into a derivative (eg a futures contract designed to cover any price rise) which it designates as a hedging instrument. 
 - or, if a company is concerned that interest rates will rise on its debt finance, then it could designate this as a hedged item and enter into a derivative (eg an interest rate swap) which it designates as a hedging instrument.
- **For effective cash flow hedge** the results are recognised in **other comprehensive income**, thus creating a reserve in equity. If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, any gain or loss on the hedging instrument that was previously recognised directly in equity is recycled from reserves into the statement of profit or loss in the same period(s) in which the financial asset or liability affects profit or loss.
- If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the **recognition of a non-financial asset**, then the entity has an **accounting policy option** that must be applied to all such hedges of forecast transactions:
 1. One policy is to apply the same accounting as for recognition of a financial asset or financial liability, in that any gain or loss on the hedging instrument that was previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recycled from reserves into the statement of profit or loss in the same period(s)in which the non-financial asset or liability affects profit or loss. 
 2. The other policy is to make an adjustment on the acquired non-financial asset, so that the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that was previously recognised in other comprehensive income is removed from reserves and is included in the initial measurement of the acquired non-financial asset.

**Examples - accounting for cash flow hedge**:

- 1 *Effective cash flow hedge*:
  - During year 1, a company is planning to buy an asset in the next accounting period at a an estimated cost of $100m, but it is concerned that the cost of buying the asset will rise. The company can designate the risk of the future cash out flows rising as a hedged item and enter into a derivative, the hedging instrument to cover this risk. This is a cash flow hedge. Let us suppose at the year 1 reporting date the estimated cost of the asset had risen to $120m and the hedging instrument was reporting a gain of $19m then the hedge is 95% effective (19/20 = 95%) and so within the 80% – 125% rule. The gain of $19m that has arisen in respect of the derivative has to be recognised, and as it is the hedging instrument of a cash flow hedge, it **is recognised in other comprehensive income** and creates a reserve (often called other components of equity). The gain (or loss) on a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge is in effect carried forward and is delayed being recognised in the statement of profit of loss. There can be no offset in the current accounting period as the potential extra cost of $20m of buying the assets is a notional number and not one that is yet recognised in the financial statements, as after all the asset has yet to be bought.
- 2 *Uneffective cash flow hedge*:
  - If, let's say, in the example above, the cost of the asset had only risen by $9.5m then the cash flow hedge would be 200% effective (19/9.5 = 200%) and therefore outside of the 80–125% effectiveness rule. The hedging relationship **is not highly effective and therefore hedge accounting is not permitted**. The whole $19m gain on the hedging instrument must **therefore be recognised in the statement of profit or loss**. 
- 3 *Example 1 forward, in Y2 - hedge was effective, the asset is bought and it's a financial asset*:
  - However, assuming as in Example 1, the hedge was effective at the reporting date and we then jump forward a few months into the middle of year 2 and further assume that the asset is indeed bought for $120m and is a financial asset, then the previously recognised gain of $19m on the hedging instrument sitting in reserves is recycled from equity and recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Recycling has meant that this gain of $19m has appeared within the statement of comprehensive income in two consecutive years, firstly in other comprehensive income and secondly in the statement of profit or loss. 
  - Many argue that recycling is double counting and therefore inappropriate. This is one of the few remaining situations of recycling being permitted by reporting standards. For example IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment clearly prohibits the recycling of previously recognised gains on the disposal of revalued property. The other comprehensive statement must clearly distinguish between those gains and losses which may or may not be recycled to the statement of profit or loss in future periods.
- 4 *Cash flow hedge subsequently resulted in non-financial asset*:
  - If the asset is a non-financial asset – for example, inventory that is sold in the accounting period – then the previously recognised gain of $19m on the hedging instrument can be recycled from its reserve in equity and recognised in the statement of profit or loss. However, if the asset is property, plant and equipment, then the reserve would be recycled over the useful life of the property, plant and equipment.

### New proposals of iFRS 9 to IAS 39:

#### Hedge effectiveness

 - effectiveness test will be on prospective basis;
 - test for 80 - 125% rule has to be dropped;
 - effectiveness will assessed by a review of the risk management strategy – with a requirement that no systematic under or over hedging is expected

#### Hedging relationship

- to qualify for hedge accounting it should comply with the following rules:
  - there should be an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item,
  - the effect of credit risk should not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship, and
  - the hedge ratio should reflect the actual quantity of hedging instrument used to hedge the actual quantity of hedge item.
